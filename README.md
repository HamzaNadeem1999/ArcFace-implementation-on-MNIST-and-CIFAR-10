# ArcFace-implementation-on-MNIST-and-CIFAR-10
Developed a robust classification model using PyTorch, combining a custom ArcFace loss function with a Convolutional Neural Network to enhance feature embeddings and enforce angular margin constraints, achieving 98.68% test accuracy on MNIST and 74% on CIFAR-10.
